## Epic Description

This epic focuses on enhancing the system architecture of MathPuzzleQuest to ensure it meets the growing demands of its user base while maintaining a secure and consistent user experience. The epic encompasses the development of a robust authentication system, a scalable backend architecture, and a unified design system. These improvements are crucial for supporting the app's educational goals by providing a seamless and secure platform for users.

The robust authentication system will ensure that user data, especially that of children, is protected in compliance with COPPA and GDPR regulations. A scalable backend architecture will allow the app to handle increased user loads efficiently, maintaining performance and reliability. The unified design system will ensure a consistent look and feel across the app, enhancing the user experience and supporting the app's educational objectives.

This epic is integral to the overall product as it addresses key architectural components that underpin the app's functionality and user experience. By focusing on scalability, security, and consistency, this epic will enable MathPuzzleQuest to grow its user base while maintaining high standards of performance and user trust.
