**Date**: October 15, 2025
**Status**: Week 2 Goals Achieved
**Next**: Week 3 - Testing & Polish

---

## What We Built

### 3 Major Slash Commands âœ…

#### 1. `/titanium:work` - Core Orchestration Command
**File**: `commands/titanium-work.md` (500+ lines)

**Purpose**: Complete workflow orchestration from planning to completion

**5 Phases Implemented**:
1. **Pre-Flight** - Validate setup, check for existing plan
2. **Planning** - Generate plan if needed (or skip if exists)
3. **Implementation** - Sequential agent execution with quality gates
4. **Review** - Parallel multi-agent quality review
5. **Completion** - Finalize and store results

**Key Features**:
- âœ… Checks for existing plan (can skip planning phase)
- âœ… Integrated plan_parser.py for GPT-4 plan generation
- âœ… Uses workflow_state.py for phase tracking
- âœ… Creates comprehensive TodoWrite lists from plans
- âœ… Sequential agent execution (one task at a time)
- âœ… vibe-check quality gates after each task and epic
- âœ… Pieces memory storage after each epic
- âœ… User approval required before implementation
- âœ… Error handling for all failure scenarios
- âœ… Voice feedback throughout (via existing hooks)
- âœ… Final completion summary with metrics

**Agent Coordination**:
- Parses task assignments from plan
- Launches agents with detailed context
- Waits for completion before next task
- Validates with vibe-check between tasks
- Stores milestones in Pieces after epics

**Integration Points**:
- workflow_state.py (phase management)
- plan_parser.py (plan generation)
- vibe-check MCP (quality gates)
- Pieces MCP (memory storage)
- TodoWrite (task tracking)
- Task tool (agent launching)

---

#### 2. `/titanium:review` - Quality Review Command
**File**: `commands/titanium-review.md` (400+ lines)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive parallel multi-agent quality review

**8-Step Process**:
1. **Identify Review Scope** - Recent changes, branch changes, specific files, or all code
2. **Launch Agents in Parallel** - 3 review agents simultaneously
3. **Wait for Completion** - All agents finish concurrently
4. **Aggregate Findings** - Collect and categorize by severity
5. **Meta-Review** - vibe-check provides AI oversight
6. **Create Report** - Comprehensive markdown report
7. **Store in Pieces** - Save findings for future reference
8. **Present Summary** - Actionable findings with priorities

**Three Review Agents**:

1. **@code-reviewer**:
   - Code quality and readability
   - Best practices (DRY, SOLID)
   - Error handling
   - Performance issues
   - Maintainability

2. **@security-scanner**:
   - Input validation
   - Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, etc.)
   - Authentication/authorization
   - Sensitive data handling
   - Dependency vulnerabilities
   - API security

3. **@tdd-specialist**:
   - Test coverage analysis
   - Test quality assessment
   - Missing test cases
   - Edge case coverage
   - Test organization

**Severity Categories**:
- ðŸ”´ **Critical** - Must fix before deployment
- ðŸŸ¡ **Important** - Should fix soon
- ðŸŸ¢ **Nice-to-have** - Optional improvements

**Report Format**:
- Executive summary
- Critical issues with file:line references
- Important issues with recommendations
- Nice-to-have improvements
- Test coverage analysis
- Security analysis
- vibe-check meta-review
- Prioritized recommendations
- List of files reviewed

**Output**: `.titanium/review-report.md`

---

#### 3. `/titanium:status` - Progress Tracking Command
**File**: `commands/titanium-status.md` (350+ lines)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive workflow status and progress reporting

**8-Step Process**:
1. **Check Workflow State** - Read .titanium/workflow-state.json
2. **Query Pieces** - Get recent work context
3. **Check for Plan** - Read plan details if exists
4. **Analyze TodoWrite** - Progress tracking (if in active session)
5. **Calculate Metrics** - Progress %, time estimates
6. **Present Report** - Formatted status display
7. **Status by Phase** - Phase-specific information
8. **Voice Summary** - Optional spoken status

**Status Information**:
- Current phase and status
- Timeline (started, elapsed, estimated remaining)
- Progress percentage
- Completed vs pending tasks
- Current task (if in progress)
- Project structure (epics, stories, tasks)
- Agents used/planned
- Recent work from Pieces
- Phase history with timestamps
- Time estimates vs actual
- Key files created/modified
- Next steps recommendations

**Status Variations**:
- Planning phase status
- Implementation phase status
- Review phase status
- Completed status
- No active workflow status

**Voice Summary**:
- Optional concise spoken summary
- Under 100 words
- Key metrics and current activity
- Next major milestone

**Integration**:
- Works across sessions (reads from files)
- Queries Pieces for full context
- Shows TodoWrite progress if available
- Handles missing data gracefully

## Known Limitations

### By Design

1. **Sequential Implementation**:
   - Tasks execute one at a time
   - Design choice for quality control
   - Could be parallelized in future

2. **Session-Specific TodoWrite**:
   - TodoWrite state doesn't persist across sessions
   - Plan.json provides persistence
   - Status command handles this gracefully

3. **Manual Review Fixes**:
   - Review identifies issues
   - User must approve fixes
   - Claude can fix if requested

### Technical

1. **No Automated Testing**:
   - Commands are markdown instructions
   - Testing requires actual Claude execution
   - Will test in Week 3

2. **No Database**:
   - All state in JSON files
   - By design (no database in plugins)
   - Pieces provides backup

3. **Voice Depends on Hooks**:
   - Voice handled by existing hooks
   - Commands don't call voice directly
   - Works automatically

---

## Dependencies Summary

### Required
- **OpenAI API Key** - For plan_parser.py (GPT-4)
- **UV** - For running utility scripts
- **Python 3.11+** - For utility scripts

### Recommended
- **ElevenLabs API Key** - For voice (optional, fallback to macOS say)
- **vibe-check MCP** - For quality gates (optional but highly recommended)
- **Pieces OS + CLI** - For memory (optional but highly recommended)

### Optional
- **Git** - For review scope detection
- **Test framework** - For running tests during workflow

---

## API Cost Estimates

**Per Complete Workflow** (typical 4-hour workflow):

- Plan generation (GPT-4): ~$0.01
- vibe-check gates (5x): ~$0.0005
- Voice announcements (10x): ~$0.09
- **Total: ~$0.10 per workflow**

Very affordable for professional development.
