# BMAD Research - Generate Research Prompts

You are helping the user research technical decisions by generating comprehensive research prompts for web-based AI (ChatGPT, Claude web) which have web search capabilities.

## Purpose

Generate structured research prompts that users can copy to ChatGPT/Claude web to research:
- API vendors and data sources
- Authentication providers
- Hosting platforms
- Payment processors
- Third-party integrations
- Technology stack options

Results are documented in structured templates and referenced during architecture generation.

## When to Use

**During BMAD workflow**:
- After PRD mentions external APIs/vendors
- Before architecture generation
- When technical decisions need research

**Standalone**:
- Evaluating vendor options
- Comparing technologies
- Cost analysis
- Technical due diligence

## Process

### Step 1: Identify Research Topic

**If user provided topic**:
```bash
# User ran: /bmad:research "data vendors for precious metals"
```
- Topic = "data vendors for precious metals"

**If no topic**:
- Ask: "What do you need to research?"
- Show common topics:
  ```
  Common research topics:
  1. Data vendors/APIs
  2. Hosting platforms (Railway, Vercel, GCP, etc.)
  3. Authentication providers (Clerk, Auth0, custom, etc.)
  4. Payment processors (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
  5. AI/ML options (OpenAI, Anthropic, self-hosted)
  6. Database options
  7. Other (specify)

  Topic:
  ```

### Step 2: Gather Context from PRD

**If PRD exists**:
```bash
Read bmad-backlog/prd/prd.md
```

Extract relevant context:
- What features need this research?
- What are the constraints? (budget, performance)
- Any technical preferences mentioned?

**If no PRD**:
- Use topic only
- Generate generic research prompt
- Note: "Research will be more focused with a PRD"

### Step 3: Generate Research Prompt

Create comprehensive prompt for web AI.

**Topic slug**: Convert topic to filename-safe string
```python
topic_slug = topic.lower().replace(' ', '-').replace('/', '-')
# "data vendors for precious metals" ‚Üí "data-vendors-for-precious-metals"
```

**Save to**: `bmad-backlog/research/RESEARCH-{topic_slug}-prompt.md`

**Prompt content**:
```markdown
# Research Prompt: {Topic}

**COPY THIS ENTIRE PROMPT** and paste into ChatGPT (GPT-4) or Claude (web).
They have web search and can provide current, comprehensive research.

2. Review findings with team (if applicable)
3. Make final decision on {chosen option}
4. Update PRD Technical Assumptions with this research
5. Reference in Architecture document generation

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ Research Complete | ‚è≥ Awaiting Decision | ‚ùå Needs More Research

---

*Fill in this template with findings from ChatGPT/Claude web research.*
*Save this file when complete.*
*Architecture generation will reference this research.*
```

### Step 5: Present to User

```
üìã Research Prompt and Template Generated!

I've created two files:

üìÑ 1. Research Prompt
Location: bmad-backlog/research/RESEARCH-{{topic}}-prompt.md

This contains a comprehensive research prompt with your project context.

üìÑ 2. Findings Template
Location: bmad-backlog/research/RESEARCH-{{topic}}-findings.md

This is a structured template for documenting research results.

---

üîç Next Steps:

1. Open: bmad-backlog/research/RESEARCH-{{topic}}-prompt.md

2. **Copy the entire prompt**

3. Open ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com) or Claude (https://claude.ai)
   ‚Üí They have web search for current info!

4. Paste the prompt

5. Wait for comprehensive research (5-10 minutes)

6. Copy findings into template:
   bmad-backlog/research/RESEARCH-{{topic}}-findings.md

7. Save the template file

8. Come back and run:
   - /bmad:prd (if updating PRD)
   - /bmad:architecture (I'll use your research!)

---

Would you like me to show you the research prompt now?
```

**If user says yes**:
- Display the prompt file content
- User can copy directly

**If user says no**:
- "The files are ready when you need them!"

### Step 6: Store in Pieces

```
mcp__Pieces__create_pieces_memory(
  summary_description: "Research prompt for {{topic}}",
  summary: "Generated research prompt for {{topic}}. User will research: {{what to evaluate}}. Purpose: {{why needed for project}}. Findings will inform: {{PRD technical assumptions / Architecture tech stack decisions}}. Template provided for structured documentation.",
  files: [
    "bmad-backlog/research/RESEARCH-{{topic}}-prompt.md",
    "bmad-backlog/research/RESEARCH-{{topic}}-findings.md"
  ],
  project: "$(pwd)"
)
```

## Integration with Other Commands

### Called from `/bmad:prd`

When PRD generation detects research needs:
```
Claude: "I see you need data vendors. Generate research prompt?"
User: "yes"

[Runs /bmad:research "data vendors"]

Claude: "Research prompt generated. Please complete research and return when done."

[User researches, fills template]

User: "Research complete"

Claude: "Great! Continuing PRD with your findings..."
[Reads RESEARCH-data-vendors-findings.md]
[Incorporates into PRD Technical Assumptions]
```

### Used by `/bmad:architecture`

Architecture generation automatically checks for research:
```bash
ls bmad-backlog/research/RESEARCH-*-findings.md
```

If found:
- Read all findings
- Use recommendations in tech stack
- Reference research in Technology Decisions table
- Include costs from research in cost estimates

## Voice Feedback

Voice announces:
- "Research prompt generated" (when done)
- "Ready for external research" (reminder)

## Example Topics

**Data & APIs**:
- "data vendors for {domain}"
- "API marketplaces"
- "real-time data feeds"

**Infrastructure**:
- "hosting platforms for {tech stack}"
- "CI/CD providers"
- "monitoring solutions"
- "CDN providers"

**Third-Party Services**:
- "authentication providers"
- "payment processors"
- "email services"
- "SMS providers"

**AI/ML**:
- "LLM hosting options"
- "embedding models"
- "vector databases"

## Important Guidelines

**Always**:
- ‚úÖ Include project context in prompt
- ‚úÖ Generate findings template
- ‚úÖ Guide user to web AI
- ‚úÖ Store prompts in Pieces
- ‚úÖ Explain next steps clearly

**Never**:
- ‚ùå Try to research in Claude Code (limited web search)
- ‚ùå Hallucinate vendor pricing (use web AI)
- ‚ùå Skip generating findings template
- ‚ùå Forget project context in prompt

## Why This Approach

**Claude Code limitations**:
- Limited web search
- Can't browse vendor pricing pages
- May hallucinate current details

**ChatGPT/Claude Web strengths**:
- Actual web search
- Can browse documentation
- Current pricing information
- Community discussions
- Up-to-date comparisons

**Best of both worlds**:
- Claude Code: Generate prompts, manage workflow
- Web AI: Thorough research with search
- Result: Informed decisions, documented rationale

**Cost**: $0 (no API calls, just template generation)

**This command enables informed technical decisions with documented research!**
