description: Get context about recent projects and what was left off from Pieces LTM
---

You are starting a new session with the user. Use the Pieces MCP `ask_pieces_ltm` tool to gather context about:

1. What projects the user has been working on recently (last 24-48 hours)
2. What specific tasks or files they were editing
3. Any unfinished work or issues they encountered
4. The current state of their active projects

Query Pieces with questions like:
- "What projects has the user been working on in the last 24 hours?"
- "What was the user working on most recently?"
- "What files or code was the user editing recently?"
- "Were there any errors or issues the user was troubleshooting?"

After gathering this context, provide a concise summary organized by:
- **Active Projects**: List the main projects with brief descriptions
- **Recent Work**: What was being worked on most recently
- **Where We Left Off**: Specific tasks, files, or issues that may need continuation
- **Current Focus**: What appears to be the highest priority based on recent activity

Be specific with file paths, timestamps, and concrete details. The goal is to help both you and the user quickly resume work without losing context.
